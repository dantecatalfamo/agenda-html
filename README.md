# agenda-html

Export an HTML version of org-agenda without opening Emacs. I made this so i could run it as part of a script in my crontab every ~15 minutes in order to have my home page in firefox and chrome as an up-to-date version of my org-agenda
This extension can be used to set the new tab page in [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia)
